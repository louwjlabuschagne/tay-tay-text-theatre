i am so glad you made time to see me how is life tell me how is your family i have not seen them in a while you have been good busier than ever we small talk work and the weather your guard is up and i know why because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind you gave me roses and i left them there to die so this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying i am sorry for that night and i would go back to december all the time it turns out freedom is not nothing but missing you wishing i would realized what i had when you were mine i would go back to december turn around and make it alright i go back to december all the time these days i have not been sleeping staying up playing back myself leaving when your birthday passed and i did not call and i think about summer all the beautiful times i watched you laughing from the passenger side and realized i loved you in the fall and then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye so this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying i am sorry for that night and i would go back to december all the time it turns out freedom is not nothing but missing you wishing i would realized what i had when you were mine i would go back to december turn around and change my own mind i go back to december all the time i miss your tan skin your sweet smile so good to me so right and how you held me in your arms that september night the first time you ever saw me cry maybe this is wishful thinking probably mindless dreaming but if we loved again i swear i would love you right i would go back in time and change it but i cannot so if the chain is on your door i understand but this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying i am sorry for that night and i would go back to december it turns out freedom is not nothing but missing you wishing i would realized what i had when you were mine i would go back to december turn around and make it alright i would go back to december turn around and change my own mind i go back to december all the time all the time
