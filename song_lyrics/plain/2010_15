elevator buttons and morning air strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs if you were here we would laugh about their vacant stares but right now my time is theirs seems like there is always someone who disapproves they will judge it like they know about me and you and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do the jury is out but my choice is you so do not you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard the stakes are high the water is rough but this love is ours you never know what people have up their sleeves ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles but i do not care because right now you are mine and you will say do not you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard the stakes are high the water is rough but this love is ours and it is not theirs to speculate if it is wrong and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and i will fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you because i love the gap between your teeth and i love the riddles that you speak and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored because my heart is yours so do not you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard do not you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine but they cannot take what is ours they cannot take what is ours the stakes are high the water is rough but this love is ours
