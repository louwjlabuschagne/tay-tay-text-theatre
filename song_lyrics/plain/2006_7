seems the only one who does not see your beauty is the face in the mirror looking back at you you walk around here thinking you are not pretty but that is not true because i know you hold on baby you are losing it the water is high you are jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry but you do not tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you are tied together with a smile but you are coming undone i guess it is true that love was all you wanted because you are giving it away like it is extra change hoping it will end up in his pocket but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain oh because it is not his price to pay not his price to pay hold on baby you are losing it the water is high you are jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry but you do not tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you are tied together with a smile but you are coming undone hold on baby you are losing it the water is high you are jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry but you do not tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you are tied together with a smile but you are coming undone you are tied together with a smile but you are coming undone oh goodbye baby with a smile baby baby
