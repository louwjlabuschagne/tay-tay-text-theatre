loving him is like driving a new maserati down a deadend street faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly loving him is like trying to change your mind once you are already flying through the free fall like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all losing him was blue like i would never known missing him was dark grey all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there is no right answer regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong losing him was blue like i would never known missing him was dark grey all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes tell myself it is time now gotta let go but moving on from him is impossible when i still see it all in my head in burning red loving him was red losing him was blue like i would never known missing him was dark grey all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red and that is why he is spinning around in my head comes back to me burning red yeah yeah his love was like driving a new maserati down a deadend street
