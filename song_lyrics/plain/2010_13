i still remember the look on your face lit through the darkness at 158 the words that you whispered for just us to know you told me you loved me so why did you go away away i do recall now the smell of the rain fresh on the pavement i ran off the plane that july 9th the beat of your heart it jumps through your shirt i can still feel your arms but now i will go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i do not know how to be something you miss i never thought we would have a last kiss never imagined we would end like this your name forever the name on my lips i do remember the swing of your step the life of the party you are showing off again and i roll my eyes and then you pull me in i am not much for dancing but for you i did because i love your handshake meeting my father i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets how you kissed me when i was in the middle of saying something there is not a day i do not miss those rude interruptions but now i will go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i do not know how to be something you miss i never thought we would have a last kiss never imagined we would end like this your name forever the name on my lips so i will watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are hope it is nice where you are and i hope the sun shines and it is a beautiful day and something reminds you you wish you had stayed you can plan for a change in weather and time but i never planned on you changing your mind so i will go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i do not know how to be something you miss i never thought we would have a last kiss never imagined we would end like this your name forever the name on my lips just like our last kiss forever the name on my lips forever the name on my lips just like our last
