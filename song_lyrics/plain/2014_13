the drought was the very worst when the flowers that we would grown together died of thirst it was months and months of backandforth you are still all over me like a winestained dress i cannot wear anymore hung my head as i lost the war and the sky turned black like a perfect storm rain came pouring down when i was drowning that is when i could finally breathe and by morning gone was any trace of you i think i am finally clean there was nothing left to do when the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room so i punched a hole in the roof let the flood carry away all my pictures of you the water filled my lungs i screamed so loud but no one heard a thing rain came pouring down when i was drowning that is when i could finally breathe and by morning gone was any trace of you i think i am finally clean i think i am finally clean ten months sober i must admit just because you are clean do not mean you do not miss it ten months older i will not give in now that i am clean i am never gonna risk it the drought was the very worst when the flowers that we would grown together died of thirst rain came pouring down when i was drowning that is when i could finally breathe and by morning gone was any trace of you i think i am finally clean rain came pouring down when i was drowning that is when i could finally breathe and by morning gone was any trace of you and i think i am finally clean
