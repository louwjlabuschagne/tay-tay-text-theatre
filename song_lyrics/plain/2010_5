long were the nights when my days once revolved around you counting my footsteps praying the floor will not fall through again my mother accused me of losing my mind but i swore i was fine you paint me a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain and i lived in your chess game but you changed the rules everyday wonderiand which version of you i might get on the phone tonight well i stopped pickiand up and this song is to let you know why dear john i see it all now that you are gone do not you think i was too young to be messed with the girl in the dress cried the whole way home i should have known well maybe it is me and my blind optimism to blame or maybe it is you and your sick need to give love and take it away and you will add my name to your long list of traitors who do not understand and i look back in regret how i ignored when they said run as fast as you can dear john i see it all now that you are gone do not you think i was too young to be messed with the girl in the dress cried the whole way home dear john i see it all now it was wrong do not you think nineteeands too young to be played by your dark twisted games when i loved you so i should have known you are an expert at sorry and keeping the lines blurry never impressed by me acing your tests all the girls that you have run dry have tired lifeless eyes because you burned them out but i took your matches before fire could catch me so do not look now i am shining like fireworks over your sad empty town yeah oh oh oh oh oh oh dear john i see it all now that you are gone do not you think i was too young to be messed with the girl in the dress cried the whole way home i see it all now that you are gone do not you think i was too young to be messed with the girl in the dress wrote you a song you should have known you should have known do not you think i was too young you should have known
