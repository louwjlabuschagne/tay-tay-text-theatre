the way you move is like a full on rainstorm and i am a house of cards you are the kind of reckless that should send me running but i kinda know that i will not get far and you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch close enough to hope you could not see what i was thinking of drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain because i see sparks fly whenever you smile get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down give me something that will haunt me when you are not around because i see sparks fly whenever you smile my mind forgets to remind me you are a bad idea you touch me once and it is really something you find i am even better than you imagined i would be i am on my guard for the rest of the world but with you i know it is no good and i could wait patiently but i really wish you would drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain because i see sparks fly whenever you smile get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down give me something that will haunt me when you are not around because i see sparks fly whenever you smile i run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild just keep on keeping your eyes on me it is just wrong enough to make it feel right and lead me up the staircase will not you whisper soft and slow i am captivated by you baby like a firework show drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain because i see sparks fly whenever you smile get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down give me something that will haunt me when you are not around because i see sparks fly whenever you smile and the sparks fly oh baby smile and the sparks fly
