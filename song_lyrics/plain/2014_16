we are all bored we are all so tired of everything we wait for trains that just are not coming we show off our different scarlet letters trust me mine is better we are so young but we are on the road to ruin we play dumb but we know exactly what we are doing we cry tears of mascara in the bathroom honey life is just a classroom because baby i could build a castle out of all the bricks they threw at me and every day is like a battle but every night with us is like a dream baby we are the new romantics come on come along with me heartbreak is the national anthem we sing it proudly we are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet baby we are the new romantics the best people in life are free we are all here the lights and noise are blinding we hang back it is all in the timing it is poker you cannot see it in my face but i am about to play my ace we need love but all we want is danger we team up then switch sides like a record changer the rumors are terrible and cruel but honey most of them are true because baby i could build a castle out of all the bricks they threw at me and every day is like a battle but every night with us is like a dream baby we are the new romantics come on come along with me heartbreak is the national anthem we sing it proudly we are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet baby we are the new romantics the best people in life are free please take my hand and please take me dancing and please leave me stranded it is so romantic it is so romantic because baby i could build a castle out of all the bricks they threw at me and every day is like a battle but every night with us is like a dream because baby i could build a castle out of all the bricks they threw at me and every day is like a battle but every night with us is like a dream baby we are the new romantics come on come along with me heartbreak is the national anthem we sing it proudly we are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet baby we are the new romantics the best people in life are free
