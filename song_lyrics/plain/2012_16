took a deep breath in the mirror he did not like it when i wore high heels but i do turn the lock and put my headphones on he always said he did not get this song but i do i do walked in expecting you would be late but you got here early and you stand and wave i walk to you you pull my chair out and help me in and you do not know how nice that is but i do and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid i think it is strange that you think i am funny because he never did i have been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again you said you never met one girl who had as many james taylor records as you but i do we tell stories and you do not know why i am coming off a little shy but i do and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid i think it is strange that you think i am funny because he never did i have been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again and we walked down the block to my car and i almost brought him up but you start to talk about the movies that your family watches every single christmas and i want to talk about that and for the first time what is past is past because you throw your head back laughing like a little kid i think it is strange that you think i am funny because he never did i have been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
