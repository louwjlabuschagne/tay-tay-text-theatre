i walked through the door with you the air was cold but something about it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sisters house and you have still got it in your drawer even now oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze we are singing in a car getting lost upstate the autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place and i can picture it after all these days and i know it is long gone and that magic is not here no more and i might be okay but i am not fine at all because there we are again on that little town street you almost ran the red because you were looking over at me wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed and your mothers telling stories about you on the tee ball team you taught me about your past thinking your future was me and i know it is long gone and there was nothing else i could do and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to because there we are again in the middle of the night we are dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well yeah and maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece untill you tore it all up running scared i was there i remember it all too well and you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of being honest i am a crumpled up piece of paper lying here because i remember it all all all too well time will not fly it is like i am paralyzed by it i would like to be my old self again but i am still trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and i walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week because it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you cannot get rid of it because you remember it all too well yeah because there we are again when i loved you so back before you lost the one real thing you have ever known it was rare i was there i remember it all too well wind in my hair you were there you remember it all down the stairs you were there you remember it all it was rare i was there i remember it all too well
