there i was again tonight forcing laughter faking smiles same old tired lonely place walls of insincerity shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when i saw your face all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you your eyes whispered have we met across the room your silhouette starts to make its way to me the playful conversation starts counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy and it was enchanting to meet you all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you this night is sparkling do not you let it go i am wonderstruck blushing all the way home i will spend forever wondering if you knew i was enchanted to meet you the lingering question kept me up 2am who do you love i wonder until i am wide awake and now i am pacing back and forth wishing you were at my door i would open up and you would say hey it was enchanting to meet you all i know is i was enchanted to meet you this night is sparkling do not you let it go i am wonderstruck blushing all the way home i will spend forever wondering if you knew this night is flawless do not you let it go i am wonderstruck dancing around all alone i will spend forever wondering if you knew i was enchanted to meet you this is me praying that this was the very first page not where the storyline ends my thoughts will echo your name until i see you again these are the words i held back as i was leaving too soon i was enchanted to meet you please do not be in love with someone else please do not have somebody waiting on you please do not be in love with someone else please do not have somebody waiting on you this night is sparkling do not you let it go i am wonderstruck blushing all the way home i will spend forever wondering if you knew this night is flawless do not you let it go i am wonderstruck dancing around all alone i will spend forever wondering if you knew i was enchanted to meet you please do not be in love with someone else please do not have somebody waiting on you
