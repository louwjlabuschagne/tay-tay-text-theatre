i am walking fast through the traffic lights busy streets and busy lives and all we know is touch and go we are alone with our changing minds we fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time and i never saw you coming and i will never be the same you come around and the armor falls pierce the room like a cannon ball now all we know is do not let go we are alone just you and me up in your room and our slates are clean just twin fire signs four blue eyes so you were never a saint and i have loved in shades of wrong we learn to live with the pain mosaic broken hearts but this love is brave and wild and i never saw you coming and i will never be the same this is a state of grace this is the worthwhile fight love is a ruthless game unless you play it good and right these are the hands of fate you are my achilles heel this is the golden age of something good and right and real and i never saw you coming and i will never be the same and i never saw you coming and i will never be the same this is a state of grace this is a worthwhile fight love is a ruthless game unless you play it good and right
