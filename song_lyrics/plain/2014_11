clear blue water high tides came and brought you in and i could go on and on on and on and i will skies grew darker currents swept you out again and you are just gone and gone gone and gone in silent screams and wildest dreams i never dreamed of this this love is good this love is bad this love is alive back from the dead these hands had to let it go free and this love came back to me tossing turning struggle through the night with someone new and i could go on and on on and on lantern burning flickered in my mind for only you but you were still gone gone gone been losing grip sinking ships you showed up just in time this love is good this love is bad this love is alive back from the dead these hands had to let it go free and this love came back to me this love left a permanent mark this love is glowing in the dark these hands had to let it go free and this love came back to me your kiss my cheek i watched you leave your smile my ghost i fell to my knees when you are young you just run but you come back to what you need this love is good this love is bad this love is alive back from the dead these hands had to let it go free and this love came back to me this love left a permanent mark this love is glowing in the dark these hands had to let it go free and this love came back to me
