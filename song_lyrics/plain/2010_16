last night i heard my own heart beating sounded like footsteps on my stairs six months gone and i am still reaching even though i know you are not there i was playing back a thousand memories baby thinkiand about everything we have been through maybe i have been going back too much lately when time stood still and i had you come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said you are sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you would be here by now i know people change and these things happen but i remember how it was back then wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing cause nothing like this ever happened to them now i am pacing down the hall chasing down your street flashback to the night when you said to me nothing is gonna change not for me and you not before i knew how much i had to lose come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said you are sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you would be here by now if you are out there if you are somewhere if you are moving on i have been waiting for you ever since you have been gone i just want it back the way it was before and i just want to see you back at my front door and i say come back come back come back to me like you would before you said it is not that easy before the fight before i locked you out but i take it all back now come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said you are sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you would be here by now you would be here by now it is not the kind of ending you want to see now baby what about the ending oh i thought you would be here by now thought you would be here by now
