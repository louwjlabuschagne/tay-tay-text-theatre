i bet this time of night you are still up i bet you are tired from a long hard week i bet you are sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city and i bet sometimes you wonder about me and i just want to tell you it takes everything in me not to call you and i wish i could run to you and i hope you know that everytime i do not i almost do i almost do i bet you think i either moved on or hate you Â‘cause each time you reach out there is no reply i bet it never ever occurred to you that i cannot say hello to you and risk another goodbye and i just want to tell you it takes everything in me not to call you and i wish i could run to you and i hope you know that everytime i do not i almost do i almost do oh we made quite a mess babe it is probably better off this way and i confess baby in my dreams you are touching my face and asking me if i would want to try again with you and i almost do and i just want to tell you it takes everything in me not to call you and i wish i could run to you and i hope you know that everytime i do not i almost do i almost do i bet this time of night you are still up i bet you are tired from a long hard week i bet you are sittiand in your chair by the window looking out at the city and i hope sometimes you wonder about me
