you said it in a simple way 4 am the second day how strange that i do not know you at all stumbled through the long goodbye one last kiss then catch your flight right when i was just about to fall i told myself do not get attached but in my mind i play it back spinning faster than the plane that took you and this is when the feeling sinks in i do not wanna miss you like this come back be here come back be here i guess you are in new york today i do not wanna need you this way come back be here come back be here the delicate beginning rush the feeling you can know so much without knowing anything at all and now that i can put this down if i had known what i would known now i never would have played so nonchalant taxi cabs and busy streets that never bring you back to me i cannot help but wish you took me with you and this is when the feeling sinks in i do not wanna miss you like this come back be here come back be here i guess you are in london today i do not wanna need you this way come back be here come back be here this is falling in love in the cruelest way this is falling for you and you are worlds away new york be here but you are in london and i break down cause it is not fair that you are not around i do not wanna miss you like this come back be here come back be here
